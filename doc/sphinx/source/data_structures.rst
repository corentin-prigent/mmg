Data structures
###############

In **mmg**, several data structures are defined in order to represent and 
manipulate different entities such as tetrahedra, triangles, meshes or level-sets.

Mesh
----

The main data structure that is used throughout **mmg** is the mesh structure ``MMG5_Mesh``.
This structure contains the following fields:

.. doxygenstruct:: MMG5_Mesh
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

Tetrahedra are represented using the **MMG5_Tetra** structure:

.. doxygenstruct:: MMG5_Tetra
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
